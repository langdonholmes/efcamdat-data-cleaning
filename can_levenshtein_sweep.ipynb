    "### Edit Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "Levenshtein distance computes the edit distance between two strings. Allowable operations are deletions, insertions, and substitutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will need to be prompt specific. So we will run the code separately for each prompt, for each level.\n",
    "\n",
    "We run into a factorial situation if we compare every sample with every other sample (N!). \n",
    "\n",
    "A potential way around this computationally expensive approach would be to create a median string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we have some responses that are more or less echos of the prompt. These responses will be similar to each other. We can compute the median string from this bag of highly similar responses. Rather than comparing the next response to each of these, we can compare it to the median string. There will probably be one median string that closely approximates the prompt (in terms of edit distance, in reality it will be a gibberish stream of characters).\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, that's a lot of writing. Let's see what happens when we code it :)"

Once we have a list of somewhat frequent N-grams, we could fuzzy match (which also uses Levenshtein distance) all the responses for those N-grams. I'm going to hold off on this because I don't really see the merit at the data cleaning stage. These methods could be helpful if we build TF-IDF vectors. Basically, these N-grams that come from the prompt are certianly less useful predictors than other strings, but I don't think they should invalidate the entire sample, so we might want to think about a weighting scheme for them. TF-IDF does the weighting for us, and fuzzy matching (if we figure out a reasonable implementation) would handle spelling errors and slight variations on the Ngrams.\n",
