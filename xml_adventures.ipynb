Like most things, I'm not sure about this.\n",

This would have the important advantage of preserving the original, misspelled response as well as a reasonable prediction of the intended orthography. I am not sure how we could incorporate both the uncorrected and corrected texts into a single model, but I sort of like the workflow here anyway."
