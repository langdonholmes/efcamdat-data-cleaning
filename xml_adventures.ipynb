Even if these responses are not just echos of the prompt, I do not think they can tell us very much about the writer, since there is very little variation between them. Like most things, I'm not sure about this.\n",

    "    **Actually, I think the best way to do this would be through spaCy.** I don't know if spaCy has an in-built spell checker, but we could add a spell checker to a custom spaCy pipeline. This would have the important advantage of preserving the original, misspelled response as well as a reasonable prediction of the intended orthography. I am not sure how we could incorporate both the uncorrected and corrected texts into a single model, but I sort of like the workflow here anyway."
